# Family Meal App

## written in Vue with Bulma CSS

## Outline

I wrote this app to provide an accessible meal plan for the Family

The app uses `localStorage` as an in-browser persistent database (with JSON.parse / JSON.stringify)

Once a week of meals is planned, it is stored for later sessions on the same device / same browser

You can always plan your meals for maximum one week ahead

It is written in german with our own personal meals listed

## Feature Roadmap

- Allow a user to insert their own meals

- Search through meals

- Remove meals that already happend (past dates)

- Print out a shopping list based on a meal plan

- Connect database, offer user authentication / authorization -> publish / share your meals

### Feel free to custumize and deploy it for your own family or needs!

### And _Bon Appetit!_
